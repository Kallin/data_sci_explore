## Data Science Exploration

This project is a repository for all the machine-learning / data-science experimentation I have been doing. It currently
includes notes and examples from
[a great book](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning),
and attempts at Kaggle projects.

## Installation

All of the code in this project should be runnable via docker. Simply run `docker-compose up` from the root of the project
and explore the IPython notebooks.

As much as possible I've tried to make it so the examples can be re-run as many times as possible, in case you want
to step through the code. If there are any notebooks where that is not the case I'll try to call it out.


## Exploring

You should be able to jump into the root of the notebooks straight from github right
[here](work/index.ipynb)!
