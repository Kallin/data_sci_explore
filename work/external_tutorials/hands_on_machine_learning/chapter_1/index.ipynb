    "### Types of Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Can be classified as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- supervised/unsupervised\n",
    "- online/batch (can they learn on the fly)\n",
    "- instance based vs. model based. (compare to existing data or build a model)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "4 types:\n",
    "- Supervised\n",
    "- Unsupervised\n",
    "- Semi-Supervised\n",
    "- Reinforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is given solutions (labels) to the training data so that it knows how it should be labeling. Often used for classification (hotdog/not-hotdog) or regression (finding a numeric value based on attributes, aka real estate price based on location/size/etc).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some regression algorithms can be used for classification, ie. to give a % chance that something is a given classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common algortihms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- k-nearest neighbors\n",
    "- linear regression\n",
    "- logistic regression\n",
    "- support vector machines (SVMs)\n",
    "- decision trees / random forests\n",
    "- neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Unsupervised\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is unlabled. System tries to find patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- clustering\n",
    "- k-means\n",
    "- hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA)\n",
    "- expectation maximization\n",
    "- visualization and dimensionality reduction\n",
    "- principal component analysis (PCA)\n",
    "- kernal PCA\n",
    "- locally-linear embedding (LLE)\n",
    "- t-stochastic neigbor embedding (t-SNE)\n",
    "- association rule learning\n",
    "- apriori\n",
    "- eclat\n",
    "\n",
    "*clustering* can find large groups that share characteristic you may have never considered. ie, 50% of all users are from a given city and of a certain age etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*visualization* takes a high dimensionality dataset and reduces it to 2/3D so that it can be visualized so humans can look for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "*dimensionality reduction* is related to visualization. it's the process of combining attributes that are highly correlated. This can improve the speed and accuracy of model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "*anomaly detection* is when the algorithm detects unusual data points. useful for fraud prevention etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "*association rule learning* is discovering interesting relations between attributes. ie. a driver that drives over 100km/day often speeds etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Semi-supervised\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is mostly unlabeled with some labels. Combination of supervised/unsupervised algorithms. IE, identify a few faces  in pictures and photo app identifies the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reinforcement\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent is exposed to an environment, and then rewarded/penalized based on it's actions (policy). Maximuming rewards and minimizing penalties can lead to strong policies. IE alphaGO.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Batch vs Online learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Some machine learning algorithms can learn incrementally, some cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 types:\n",
    "- Batch\n",
    "- Online\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Batch\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is trained using all available data at once. It can be resource intensive. If you want to add new datapoints for the model to consider, the entire system needs to be retrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Online\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is fed to the system incrementally, or in small batches. Learning is fast, so the system can adapt to changing conditions on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Online learning can happen 'out of core' when training set doesn't fit in memory. Here, the training data is split into multiple batches to be run sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'learning rate' affects how quickly/slowly an online model adapts to change. Too quick and they will forget older patterns, too slow and they will fail to adjust to new patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad data can corrupt the model, and may require rolling back to a known 'good' model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instance-Based Versus Model-Based Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Defines how data is generalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 types:\n",
    "- Instance-Based\n",
    "- Model-Based\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance-Based\n",
    "\n",
    "Samples are memorized by the system, and new data is compared to samples using a measure of similarity to find the most similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model-Based\n",
    "\n",
    "System builds a model, and that model is used to make predictions. Original samples can be forgotten.\n",

    "- Feature Extraction: Combining features to produce richer featuers, aka dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- Creating new features by collecting more data.\n",

    "#### Overfitting the Training Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performs well on training data, but doesn't generalize well. Can happen when model is too complex compared to size and noisiness of training data.\n",

Often 80% training and 20% test split is used.
