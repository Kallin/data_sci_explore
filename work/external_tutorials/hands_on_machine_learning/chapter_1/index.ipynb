    "Q1: How would you define machine learning?\n",
    "A1: A programming technique by which software is able to solve problems without being explicity told how to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Can you name 4 types of problems where it shines?\n",
    "A2: \n",
    "- Finding non-obvious patterns\n",
    "- Image recognition\n",
    "- Classification\n",
    "- Value prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What is a labeled training set?\n",
    "A3: A dataset with some categorical value that we want to predict already labelled. Used for building a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: What are the two most common supervised tasks?\n",
    "A4: Classification / Regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Can you name 4 common unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "A5:\n",
    "- Clustering\n",
    "- Visualization\n",
    "- Dimensionality Reduction\n",

    "Q6: What type of Machine Learning algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?\n",
    "A6: Reinforcement Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What type of algorithm would you use to segment your customers into multiple groups?\n",
    "A7: Clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Would you frame the problem of spam detection as a supervised learning problem or an unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "A8: Supervised.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. What is an online learning system?\n",
    "A9: A system whereby the model adapts as it is presented with new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is out-of-core learning?\n",
    "A11: Offline, batch and combine, like a map reduce approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What type of learning algorithm relies on a similarity measure to make predictions?\n",
    "A11: Instance based learning tries to find the most similar from a memorized dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. What is the difference between a model parameter and a learning algorithmâ€™s hyperparameter?\n",
    "A12: Hyperparameters are used for tuning the algorithm. Model parameters are the specific values derived for a given model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What do model based learning algorithms search for? What is the most common strategy they use to succeed? How do they make predictions?\n",
    "A13: They search for optimal parameters for minimizing the errors of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. Can you name 4 of the main challenges in Machine Learning?\n",
    "A14:\n",
    "- not enough data\n",
    "- dirty data\n",
    "- time/performance\n",
    "- underfitting/overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "Q15. If your model performs great on the training data but generalizes poorly to new instances, what is happening? Can you name 3 possible solutions?\n",
    "A15:\n",
    "- Overfitting\n",
    "- Unrepresentative training data\n",
    "- Not cross-validating\n",
    "\n",
    "Q16. What is a test set and why would you want to use it?\n",
    "A16: A set of data you put aside until the end to verify how the model performs on unseen data. Used to estimate the error the model will make on new data in production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q17. What is the purpose of a validation set?\n",
    "A17: A second holdout set after the test set. Used to validate that model on totally unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q18. What can go wrong if you tune hyperparameters using the test set?\n",
    "A18: It will not generalize to other data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q19. What is cross-validation and why would you prefer it to a validation set?\n",
    "A19: A technique where random validation/test sets are created and the average performance of all is obtained."
